writ-\ning/reading register values and an ALU (Arithmetic Logical Unit) to perform computations;\n\u2022psim , a standalone simulator for the PIPE implementation of the chArm-v2 instruction set architec-\nture (ISA), assuming an ideal memory system;\n\u2022csim , a standalone trace-driven cache simulator for a simple two-level memory hierarchy; and\n\u2022pcsim , an integrated \u201cPIPE-with-CACHE\u201d simulator, by enhancing psim to handle variable delays\nin the memory stage, and connecting it to csim , resulting in a simulator for the PIPE implementation\nof the chArm-v2 ISA with a simple two-level memory hierarchy.\nThe common executable that you will create will be named se. You will be working on the aeand\npsim aspects of it in the first two weeks, upgrading the psim in the third week, and on the csim and\npcsim aspects in the fourth week.\nOutcomes you will gain from this lab include the following:\n\u2022 You will understand how the SEQ and PIPE- implementations of chArm-v2 work. You will under-\nstand the utilities of each stage and how they are connected to each other.\n\u2022 You will understand how the PIPE implementation of chArm-v2 works.

You are required to perform three\nsubmissions:\n\u2022 AE and PIPE-, due by Thursday, 11 April 2024 23:59 CT.\n\u2022 PIPE, due by Thursday, 18 April 2024 23:59 CT.\n\u2022 CSIM and PCSIM, due by Thursday, 25 April 2024 23:59 CT.\nStart early enough to get the assignment done before the due date. Assume things will not go accord-\ning to plan, and so you must allow extra time for heavily loaded systems, dropped internet connections,\ncorrupted files, traffic delays, minor health problems, force majeure , etc.\nThis is an individual or partner project. If you choose to work in pairs, the team may use as many slip\ndays as the partner with the fewest available slip days. That is, if you have two slip days and your partner\nhas three, the team gets two slip days to use for the entire assignment. Both partners will be charged for any\nslip days used. Note that using slip days for a checkpoint does not adjust any future due dates. Choose your\npartner well; you will not be allowed to split up during the project. Partners on a team do not have to be\nfrom the same section of the class.\nAll hand-ins are electronic. You may do your coding on any machine you choose, but it is your respon-\nsibility to test this assignment for correct build/execution on an UTCS 64-bit x86-64 Linux machine before\nyour final hand-in. You may not share your work on lab assignments with other students outside your team,\nbut feel free to ask instructors for help (e.g., during office hours or discussion sections). Unless it is an\nimplementation-specific question (i.e., private to instructors), please post it on Ed Discussion publicly so\nthat students with similar questions can benefit as well.\nBefore you begin, please take the time to review the course policy on academic integrity at: https:\n//www.cs.utexas.edu/academics/conduct . Don\u2019t copy code from anywhere; do it yourself.\nThis discipline is very important for this class and next classes.\nAny updates for this lab will be posted on Canvas. Any clarifications or corrections for this lab will be\nposted on Ed Discussion.\n3 Download and Setup\nGo to the GitHub Classroom assignment page found at: https://classroom.github.com/a/\nXrpvB4pG . You will be able to clone your assignment to a lab machine as usual. Also note that since\nyou can work in pairs, GitHub Classroom may prompt you to enter who you are working with to set up your\nrepository with them. You will only need one repository for submitting, but if both you and your partner\nmake one, just decide whose to submit later on.\n4 Assignment Details\n4.1 Repository Structure\nNow that you have your private repository of the code base, confirm that you have the following subdirec-\ntories within it.\n2", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2765, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4e54edf0-0f26-4413-806e-d675d0d905d0": {"__data__": {"id_": "4e54edf0-0f26-4413-806e-d675d0d905d0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "selab.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/jeremychuah/convergent-education/backend/test/selab.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 122968, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "91b0528f-8c8b-47bf-94ed-a7626dc2153a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "selab.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/jeremychuah/convergent-education/backend/test/selab.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 122968, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "0441f28e29b01d5c1884e626b3277c83d67c3eb5ea9c7679b6bbe99ba16db07a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\u2022include : This subdirectory contains all the header files needed for this project. It contains three subdi-\nrectories: pipe , which contains the header files needed for the pipelined processor implementation;\ncache , which contains the header files needed for the cache simulator; and base , which contains\nthe header files needed for the underlying simulator.\n\u2022src: This subdirectory contains all the source code files needed for this project. It contains four\nsubdirectories: pipe , which contains the source code files needed for the pipelined processor imple-\nmentation; cache , which contains the source code files needed for the cache simulator; base , which\ncontains the source code files needed for the underlying simulator; and testbench , which contains\nthe source code of the executables you can use to compare your simulator to the provided reference.\nTo complete the hardware elements in AE, you will modify the file src/base/hw_elts.c .\nTo complete the pipelined processor emulator psim in PIPE, you will modify the following files:\ninstr_Fetch.c ,instr_Decode.c ,instr_Execute.c ,instr_Memory.c ,\ninstr_Writeback.c ,forward.c , and hazard_control.c . All of these files are located\nin the src/pipe directory.\nTo complete the standalone cache simulator csim for the CSIM deliverable, you will modify only the\nfilesrc/cache/cache.c .\nTo complete the final pcsim , you will further modify only these files.\n\u2022testcases : This subdirectory contains test cases for testing your emulator. The basics ,alu,mem,\nbranch ,exceptions , and applications subdirectories nested inside contain assembly .s\nfiles, disassembled .od files, and ELF binaries that are used to test your simulator. Some of these\ndirectories are further subdivided into simple ,hazard , andhard , which narrow the focus of the\ntests. Finally, the cache subdirectory contains memory trace files similar to those that you used in\nMM Lab, which are used to test your cache simulator.\n4.2 Simulator Quirks\nThere are a few things in the simulator that you would not find in normal hardware, so we would like to note\nthem here.\nFirst, it is important to note that hlt is a privileged instruction, and gcc won\u2019t typically compile files\nwith that instruction. To shut down the emulator, we instead check for a ret instruction with a return\naddress of 0, which we turn into an emulated HLT instruction that stops the simulator after it reaches the\nwriteback stage. This functionality is implemented for you in src/pipe/instr_Fetch.c , and you\nonly need to pass the generated STAT_HLT through the pipeline for it to work.\nSecond, we need ways to view the state of the machine during a program\u2019s execution for our testing\npurposes, so we have special \u201ctrap\u201d addresses defined for this purpose. In src/base/mem.c , you can\nfindIO_CHAR_ADDR andCHECKPOINT_ADDR defined. A load from CHECKPOINT_ADDR will log the\nmachine state to a provided \u201ccheckpoint file\u201d (more on this later), and a store to IO_CHAR_ADDR will print\nthe stored register\u2019s contents to the terminal.\n5 Programming Tasks\nThis lab is a sequence of two programming parts. In Checkpoint 1, you will implement ae, an architec-\nture element emulator (ALU, register file, etc.) and psim , a PIPE- simulator.

It will be updated on an ongoing basis through the assignment.\n5.1 Part A: Implementing psim , A Simulator for the PIPE Implementation\nThe goal for Part A is to implement a PIPE simulator as described in class. You are going to complete\nthe code in files instr_Fetch.c ,instr_Decode.c ,instr_Execute.c ,instr_Memory.c ,\ninstr_Writeback.c ,forward.c , and hazard_control.c , all of which are located in the di-\nrectory src/pipe . You will need to complete all functions in the files that are marked as \u201cSTUDENT\nTO-DO\u201d. The hardware elements you need are implemented for you in src/base/hw_elts.c .\n5.1.1 Architecture Emulator\nStart by implementing the hardware elements in the hw_elts.c file. These emulate modules found in the\nhardware that will be called upon in your pipeline. Once you do these correctly, you will be able to pass all\nthe tests in the bin/test-ae testbench.\nYou are required to implement three functions that emulate three hardware modules for your AE simu-\nlator:\n\u2022cond holds() : This module determines if a given condition code is met based on the NCZV flag\nstate. This should not be directly invoked from your pipeline emulator.\n\u2022alu: This module computes bitwise and mathematical operations like addition or shifts, and sets\nthe NCZV flags accordingly. This module will also invoke the cond_holds() module to set a\ncondition value.\n\u2022regfile : This module will allow you to simultaneously read and write to registers. Take care to\nhandle writes to and reads from the SP and XZR registers properly, which are not general-purpose.\nAE will need to be complete for the PIPE- implementation to function properly. If in doubt, read the\nARM manual linked on the syllabus page.\n5.1.2 Testing AE\nMake your testbench test-ae in the usual manner: make clean; make . There is no standalone ae\nexecutable.

If you do this correctly, you will\nbe able to pass all the tests in the testcases/basics andtestcases/ */simple directories.\nYou are required to implement five functions that emulate five stages for your PIPE- simulator:1\n\u2022fetch instr() : Fetch stage (including PC update actions).\n\u2022decode instr() : Decode stage.\n\u2022execute instr() : Execute stage.\n\u2022memory instr() : Memory stage.\n\u2022wback instr() : Write-back stage.\nThere are a number of other functions in this file that correspond to the various logic blocks discussed in\nclass. You must implement these functions as well, and then \u201cwire them up\u201d appropriately within the stage\nlogic.\nThe fields of the pipeline registers are defined in include/pipe/instr_pipeline.h in several\nstruct types *_instr_impl_t andpipe_reg_t . The \u201cclocking\u201d of these registers is handled for\nyou in src/base/proc.c . When implementing the combinational logic for a pipeline stage, you will be\npassed in the appropriate structs as your input and output arguments, which are named inandout. There\nare also a few global variables that represent the \u201cbackwards\u201d wires sent from one stage to a prior stage,\nwhich you will need to update as well.\n5.1.4 Hazard Control\nFor the second week, you are also required to implement stalling, squashing, and forwarding to deal with\ndata hazards and control hazards, as discussed in class. For forwarding, add your implementation in\nsrc/pipe/forward.c and then call the resulting function(s) from src/pipe/instr_Decode.c .\nFor stalling, implement the four functions in src/pipe/hazard_control.c , which is called for you\ninsrc/base/proc.c . You are responsible for setting up the correct stall andbubble signals for\neach pipeline stage at each cycle. The task of taking the appropriate actions on the pipeline registers based\non these signals is handled for you.\n1In hardware, all the stages would execute concurrently for multiple instructions in a single cycle of a PIPE implementation.\nSince C code is executed sequentially, however, the stages run in reverse order (decode stage after execute and memory stages, and\nmemory stage before execute) in order to propagate forwarding values properly among these multiple executions in flight through\nthe pipeline. This ordering is already handled correctly in the starter code; you do not need to worry about it.\n5", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2840, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c0046f27-c4d3-47aa-b6bc-f08533883e1e": {"__data__": {"id_": "c0046f27-c4d3-47aa-b6bc-f08533883e1e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "selab.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/jeremychuah/convergent-education/backend/test/selab.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 122968, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "27eb6e3c-a8a0-454e-8578-f29b78ef36e4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "selab.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/jeremychuah/convergent-education/backend/test/selab.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 122968, "creation_date": "2024-11-12", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-12"}, "hash": "4427807c2e3f7954593934320279598b08e30aeb6767ae2dfeebb029af4a173a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "5.1.5 Testing\nMake your seexecutable in the usual manner: make clean; make .

The cycle limit can be an integer greater than 0, and\nwill set the limit on the number of cycles your simulator can run for. Its default value is 500, and most tests\ndo not require more than this, save for some of the ones in hard directories. The checkpoint file is a file\nthat will be overwritten with a \u201ccheckpoint\u201d of the machine state when the program ends or attempts to load\nfromCHECKPOINT_ADDR .\nDebug your program in the normal manner using gdb. There is also a provided se-ref executable for\neach checkpoint that you can use (with the same arguments as se) to check the correct output of a test case.\nOr you can run an exhaustive test with test-se .\n5.1.6 Visualization\nA pipeline visualization tool is provided for PIPE- and PIPE. This tool is NOT a replacement for proper\ndebugging via gdb; however, this may help you find in which instruction a testcase goes wrong. Also, this\ntool is brand-new this semester, and is therefore likely to be buggier than the other parts of the assignment.\nTo run the visualization, you will need to download the visualization folder and its contents to\nyour local machine . You only need to do this step the first time.\nNext, use the command line:\n./launch_vis_run.sh bin/se -i <testfile-path> -v <specify value larger than 0>\non your remote UTCS machine each time you want to visualize a testcase. The verbosity level must be\ngreater than 0. This will start a node server on the remote machine; make sure to stop the server with\nCTRL-C after you are done looking at the visualization.\nIf using the terminal in Visual Studio Code, you may skip this next step. If not, then run the command\nline:\nssh -N -f -L localhost:8080:localhost:8080 <USERNAME@REMOTE_MACHINE>\non your local machine . This will forward the remote port to your local port, allowing you to access the\nresults of your remote pipeline code.

Correctness will be determined by matching the cache events generated by your simulator\nagainst a reference. You will then augment psim and connect it to csim to produce pcsim .\n5.2.1 Implementation and Testing\n\u2022 Start your work in the cache directory.\n\u2022 Implement the get_line() andselect_line() helper functions in the file cache.c .

Each is to be\nsubmitted along the final week of SE Lab.\n6.1 Application: Matrix Multiplication\n2 points\nTo explore the effects of the cache in a real application, we consider several implementations of matrix-\nmatrix multiplication in the tests applications/hard/gemm_ijk ,applications/hard/gemm_ikj ,\nandapplications/hard/gemm_block . These tests take two 64 \u00d764 matrices and multiply them,\nstoring the result in another 64 \u00d764 matrix.\nNote that these tests take several million cycles to run to completion, so you need to give them several\nseconds to finish running. For this reason, do NOT run your simulator with the verbose -v flag enabled, or\nelse you will create several Gigabyte-sized files and waste large amounts of space on the lab machines.\nUsing these tests and your seexecutable, answer the following questions. You may use the se-ref\nexecutable if you are unable to pass all checkpoint 3 tests with your implementation.\n\u2022 To start, run the tests without the cache enabled. You should set the cycle limit to 8,000,000 with the\n-lflag in order to bypass the default limit of 500. You can filter the output to a checkpoint file to\nview the number of cycles the simulator runs for, so an example command would be bin/se\n-i testcases/applications/hard/gemm_ijk -c checkpoint.out -l 8000000 .\nNote the number of cycles it takes to run each test to completion.
